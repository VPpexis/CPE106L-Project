# [Project-CovidRecon](https://vppexis.github.io/CPE106L-ProjectCovidRecon/)

Project-CovidRecon is a software application based from PyQt5 and Tweepy that tracks statuses of the number of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in National Captional Region in the Philippines. Through data science and mathematical models, the cases can be predicted and visualized through charts and tables. The application also provides prediction to the number of cases in the next days through logarithmic and exponential plotting.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Python 3.7

```
Can be access by entering "python" in the terminal.
```

PyQt5

```
PyQt5 designer can be accessed through Anaconda Prompt by entering "designer".
```

Tweepy

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

Python 3.7

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. The official website of Python is https://www.python.org/. After navigating the download site with your Linux browser, click the appropriate link for your version of Linux you wish to install, then click SAVE. 

When the file is already downloaded, double click to extract. After then, open the Linux terminal.

Type the following commands then press enter:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential 
sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev
sudo apt-get install libbz2-dev
```

Type CD Python <version> in the Terminal window and press Enter so that the terminal changes its directory to the Python folder on the system.
  
Type and press enter:
```
./configure
```
The script begins by checking the system build type and then performs a series of tasks based on the system youâ€™re using. This process can require a minute or two because there is a large list of items to check.

Type the command below and press Enter:
```
sudo make altinstall
```
The system may ask you for your administrator password. Type your password and press Enter. At this point, a number of tasks take place as the system installs Python on your system.

















And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
