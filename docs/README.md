# Introduction
Data Science and mathematical models can help in shedding light on the evolution of the novel Coronavirus pandemic. By predicting, visualizing, and analyzing the virus, we will be able to put up an immunity against it through the help of data and information. This is an application that can forecast real-time COVID-19 data that can fill the gap between users and various sources of information in order to produce reliable data.  As the world plunged into a pandemic caused by COVID-19, both technology and medical field tries to understand how the virus had spread exponentially across the globe as well as on how to cure it. As people get wary about the health implications this pandemic poses on their health, economic, and social activity – they also want to gain information. However, to this day, there isn't a well-centered outlet to get data visualization and prediction of COVID-19, false information might constitute to the delay of the dissection of current data. With this application, it aims to bridge the user and the different sources of data that could visualize it for beneficiaries – not just for the people, but for health workers, and even for the common knowledge of the government. It delivers visualized data, its analysis, and the prediction of the movement of the virus. 

## Purpose
The purpose of the program is as follows:
    
* To gather COVID-19 data cases and its location
    
*  To visualize the data into charts.
    
* To predict the logarithmic and exponential pattern
    
* To show the geographical status of each province.





## Scope

The scope of this software is limited to the Philippines. To be specific the NCR Region and its cities only since the data is readily available due to the different sources and the increase of production of test kits. The software does not gather the user's data since it does not need it. The software will only gather source from 


## Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
* **Tweepy** – Tweepy is a Python library to access the Twitter API. It is usually used for simple automation and creating twitter function and bots. With Tweepy, developers can accumulate tweets, create and delete tweets, and follow or unfollow users. 
    
* **Twitter API** – The Twitter API allows the access and use of Twitter without having to go through its interface. This access is helpful when performing various automated tasks such as collecting tweets through writing a series of script codes. 
    
* **RDS** – RDS or Relational Database Services
