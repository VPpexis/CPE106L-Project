# Introduction
	Data Science and mathematical models can help in shedding light on the evolution of the novel Coronavirus 
    
    pandemic. By predicting, visualizing and analyzing the virus, we will be able to put up an immunity against it 
    
    through the help of data and information. This is an application that can forecast real time COVID-19 data that 
    
    can fill the gap between users and various source of information in order to produce reliable data.  As the 
    
    world plunged into a pandemic caused by COVID-19, both technology and medical field tries to understand how the 
    
    virus had spread exponentially across the globe as well as on how to cure it. As people get wary about the 
    
    health implications this pandemic pose on their health, economic, and social activity – they also want to gain 
    
    information. However, to this day, there isn't a well centered outlet to get data visualization and prediction 
    
    of COVID-19, false information might constitute to the delay of the dissection of current data. With this 
    
    application, it aims to bridge the user and the different sources of data that could visualize it for 
    
    beneficiaries – not just for the people, but for health workers, and even for the common knowledge of the 
    
    government. It delivers visualized data, its analysis, and prediction of the movement of the virus. 




    # Purpose
    The purpose of the program are as follows:
	
    * To gather COVID-19 data cases and its location
	
    *  To visualize the data into charts.
	
    * To predict the logarithmic and exponential pattern
    
    * To show a geographical statues of each provinces.




    # Scope
	
    The scope of this software is limited to the Philippines. To be specific the NCR Region and its cities only 
    
    since that the data is readily available due to the different sources and the increase of production of test 
    
    kits. The software does not gather the user's data since that it does not need to it. The software will only 
    
    gather source from 




    # Defnitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
	* **Tweepy** – Tweepy is a Python library to access the Twitter API. It is usually used for simple automation 
    
    and creating twitter function and bots. With Tweepy, developers can accumulate tweets, create and delete tweets,
    
    and to follow or unfollow users. 
	
    * **Twitter API** – The Twitter API allows the access and use of Twitter without having to go through its 
    
    interface. This access is helpful when performing various automated tasks such as collecting tweets through 
    
    writing series of script codes. 
    
    * **RDS** – RDS or Relational Database Service
