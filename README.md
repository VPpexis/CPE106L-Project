# Project-CovidRecon

## Introduction
	Data Science and mathematical models can help in shedding light on the evolution of the novel Coronavirus pandemic. By predicting, visualizing and analyzing the virus, we will be able to put up an immunity against it through the help of data and information. This is an application that can forecast real time COVID-19 data that can fill the gap between users and various source of information in order to produce reliable data.  As the world plunged into a pandemic caused by COVID-19, both technology and medical field tries to understand how the virus had spread exponentially across the globe as well as on how to cure it. As people get wary about the health implications this pandemic pose on their health, economic, and social activity – they also want to gain information. However, to this day, there isn't a well centered outlet to get data visualization and prediction of COVID-19, false information might constitute to the delay of the dissection of current data. With this application, it aims to bridge the user and the different sources of data that could visualize it for beneficiaries – not just for the people, but for health workers, and even for the common knowledge of the government. It delivers visualized data, its analysis, and prediction of the movement of the virus.
